# Week 1 Lab Report: Remote Access

## Setting up the terminal
1. I first opened VSCode, which I already had installed on my computer.
2. I then opened the terminal within VSCode and configured the profile to use bash rather than the default option by using the command pallette to set the default terminal profile.

## Remotely connecting
1. After resetting the password for my course-specific account and waiting for it to update, I remotely connected to it in the terminal with the command `$ ssh cs15lwi23akr@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, answering `yes` and entering my password as prompted.

## Trying commands
1. I then explored the file structure of the remote connection, experimenting with basic file navigation commands like `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`.
2. Finally, I logged out of the remote server.
